## What is it?
These scripts are wrappers for running proteomics analyses in Galaxy. The code in this repository only contains the wrappers and associated datatype and display application definitions. The actual tools themselves are available at [https://bitbucket.org/iracooke/protk](https://bitbucket.org/iracooke/protk). 

At this stage all of the tools are for peptide and protein identification using tandem ms using the [Trans Proteomic Pipeline](http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:TPP) workflow and associated programs.

## Installation
Install protk into your local galaxy instance from the main galaxy toolshed at http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/

To actually run any of the tools you will need to install the underlying scripts which can be found at [https://bitbucket.org/iracooke/protk](https://bitbucket.org/iracooke/protk)

To visualize data you will need to install the protviz visualization web application.  This is available at
